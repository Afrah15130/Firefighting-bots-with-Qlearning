# Firefighting-bots-with-Qlearning  

INTRODUCTION: 
 
Firefighting Bots are autonomous robotic systems developed to detect and extinguish fires in hazardous or inaccessible areas. These bots play a crucial role in minimizing risks to human firefighters by navigating and acting independently in emergency situations.

This project leverages Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to train the bot to make intelligent decisions. Through repeated interactions with its environment, the bot learns to identify optimal paths, avoid obstacles, and move toward fire sources. Each action taken is evaluated with rewards or penalties, enabling the bot to gradually improve its performance.

By combining robotics with artificial intelligence, this project demonstrates how Q-learning can empower machines to handle real-world challenges like fire detection and suppression effectively.
